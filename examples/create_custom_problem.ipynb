    "This tutorial shows how to implement your own Markov Decision Process (MDP) problems using MDPax. We'll implement the classic FrozenLake environment, which is a well-known example from [OpenAI's Gym/Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/).\n",

    "## MDPax Problem class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Problem` class is used to represent MDPs in MDPax. As described in the [Getting Started] notebook, it uses a functional approach to describe the MDP instead of explicitly creating transition and reward matrices. \n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a subclass of `Problem` to represent your own MDP, you will need to define an `__init__` method and the following methods marked as `@abstractmethods` in the `Problem` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `name`: A unique string identifier for the MDP\n",
    "* `_construct_state_space`: A helper function that builds an array of all possible states, with dimensions [n_states, state_dim]\n",
    "* `state_to_index`: A function that maps from a state vector to its index in the state space array\n",
    "* `_construct_action_space`: A helper function that builds an array of all possible actions, with dimensions [n_actions, action_dim]\n",
    "* `_construct_random_event_space`: A helper function that builds an array of all possible random events, with dimensions [n_events, event_dim]\n",
    "* `random_event_probability`: A function that returns the probability of a random event given a state and action\n",
    "* `transition`: A function that returns the next state and reward given a state, action, and random event. \n",
    "\n",
    "See the MDPax documentation [LINK TO DO] for detailed information about the `Problem` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll walk through implementing each of those methods for the FrozenLake problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "## FrozenLake\n",
    "\n",
    "In FrozenLake, an agent must navigate from start (S) to goal (G) on a frozen lake surface (F), avoiding holes in the ice (H).\n",
    "\n",
    "The default 4x4 map looks like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SFFF\n",
    "FHFH\n",
    "FFFH\n",
    "HFFG\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "The surface can be slippery, making movement stochastic: when the agent chooses a direction, they may instead slide perpendicular to their intended direction."
